- responsiveness -- let's make it work
- show more on tags so it's not right down the page?
- drop down nav menu from header border
- replace time-stamp on filenames with directories?
- fix search index
- remove cache
- in fact, let's rework how that works *ahem* footprint (not carbon (maybe carbon actually))

---title: uShowcase - Umbraco Photo Galleryslug: ushowcase-umbraco-photo-gallerydate: 2013-04-24 14:36tags:  - umbraco - ushowcase---So today I've released my first Umbraco project, a simple and easily modifiable photo gallery starter kit.

I'm planning on making a few gallery websites; one for myself and a few for some photographers I know. I thought the best thing to do is create a starter kit for myself, and naturally, release it into the wild.

I'll post an excerpt from the project description (which, if I might add, is terribly difficult to format using the Umbraco website).

# uShowcase
**uShowcase is a photo gallery for Umbraco.**

It comes with a very simple template which is easily modifiable but also usable right away.

## Features:
* Multiple galleries
* Rich text page documents
* Super easy to modify template

## Using uShowcase 

Using uShowcase: Under home, there is a Galleries page. This will not show up in the navigation. Create `Gallery` pages inside Galleries, and inside the `Gallery` pages, create `Photo` pages. The template uses bootstrap but the uShowcase photo grid system doesn't, so you don't *have* to have Bootstrap.

## Requirements 
*Requires ImageGen version 2.5.7 to run:

Version 1.0.1 has only been tested with Umbraco v6.0.3 - so bear that in mind.

---title: Coderbits Pie Chartsslug: coderbits-pie-chartsdate: 2013-05-23 16:36tags:  - coderbits - api - raphael - graphael - javascript---If you've taken a look at [my profile](http://www.adamkdean.co.uk/profile/index) you may have noticed that I've switched the GitHub/StackOverflow widgets out for a single Coderbits widget. Not only is this because my GitHub/ServerStack.NET API code broke, but also because I think it gives a better overview of my coding profile.

I used [Scott's Raphael pie graphs](http://jsfiddle.net/scottksmith95/wvVRY/) which Coderbits use, and mixed them with the request code from the [Coderbits js widget](https://github.com/scottksmith95/coderbits.widget). Add a little [SpiffyGif](http://spiffygif.com/) loading gif and you have yourself, in my opinion, a pretty nice looking and lightweight API-fed graph. 

You can find the code for this pie graph widget here: [https://github.com/Imdsm/Coderbits.PieCharts](https://github.com/Imdsm/Coderbits.PieCharts)  
You can try out the demo here: [http://imdsm.github.io/Coderbits.PieCharts/](http://imdsm.github.io/Coderbits.PieCharts/)

    // from
    <a href="#">link</a>

    // to
    [a href="#"]link[/a]

Obviously, we need to use RegEx here, and for future reference mainly for myself, here are the matching and replacing patterns:

    // match
    <a .*?href=['""](.+?)['""].*?>(.+?)</a>

    // replace
    [a href="$1"]$2[/a]

May as well put in the reverse as well:

    // match
    \[a .*?href=['""](.+?)['""].*?\](.+?)\[/a\]

    // replace
    <a href="$1">$2</a>

And then if you're doing this in C#, just use this method:

    string Regex.Replace(string input, string match, string replace)

There we go, saved myself about a year of tedious work!

I'm not much of a fan of the scene editor, or any of the GUI stuff, but I've been playing with [MattRix](https://twitter.com/MattRix/)'s [Futile framework](https://github.com/MattRix/Futile) and being able to do everything from a code-first perspective is awesome.

Naturally, I decided to make a simple game simulation, for science. What's simpler than a turret AI that shoots at rocks in space?

It actually works quite well. I think I had 200,000 asteroids floating around at one point with *minimal* lag. 

The thing I like about using Unity, and Futile too, is that I don't have to spend all my time working on the boilerplate code. I can just jump right in and get started on my game. I can see results quicker, and that's what I like, results.

For now, I'm either going to think of a simple game and finish the damn thing, or get on with those upgrades for this site. Hard decision.

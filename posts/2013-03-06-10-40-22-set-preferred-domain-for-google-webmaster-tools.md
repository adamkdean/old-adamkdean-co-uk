I received an error message, but no instruction on how to do so:

> Part of the process of setting a preferred domain is to verify that you own http://adamkdean.co.uk/. Please verify http://adamkdean.co.uk/.

I tried to visit the verification file using no `www.` but no dice. I also tried adding the website as the root domain, `adamkdean.co.uk`, but still no luck. 

It turns out you have to add the website *twice*, both with and without the `www` subdomain, so two entries in your webmaster tools, and two verification steps.

Could have thrown me a bone, Google!

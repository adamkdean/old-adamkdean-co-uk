---title: Excel Formula - Nice Currency!slug: excel-formula-nice-currencydate: 2011-01-26 22:05tags:  - microsoft-excel---I hate it in Excel when my currency has to be either spaced out nicely OR red when negative. There is the currency, which has nice colours, for negatives, which is good. But then the accounting format has nice spacing, with the pound sign on the left.

Well, now I can have both!

`_-£* #,##0.00;[Red]-£* #,##0.00`

Woop!

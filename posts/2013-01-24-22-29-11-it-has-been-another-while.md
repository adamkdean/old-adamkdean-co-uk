I've had a busy year and done a lot of things. Met a wonderful girl who I have been living with now for a year, and done quite a bit of design work, learning Illustrator and In Design. I haven't done as much real coding as I would have liked. My Raspberry Pi sits on top of my home server and hasn't even been turned on yet.

But that's going to change.

I have decided to choose a specialisation. Too long have I spent my IRL talent points in all talent trees. It is time I chose a specialisation and started becoming an expert, rather than just a jack of all trades.

I will be posting here more often, will probably give this blog a nice update, and a lot more code as well!

Stay tuned random internet surfers, whoever you are, I will be sharing with you some gold nuggets over the next 12 months!

usque ad proximam tempus, amici .. until next time.

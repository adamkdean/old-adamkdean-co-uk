A handy trick to circumvent this, if you have access to SSH, is to open a tunnel.

For this we're going to need:  
- The IP or hostname and port of the destination server (for this they are `192.168.1.2` and `3389`)  
- Access to a server with SSH on the local network  
- PuTTY on your local machine  

First, open up either command prompt, or MinGW or something, and navigate to your PuTTY path:

    cd /c/PuTTY/

Then connect to the SSH server specifying a tunnel like so:

    putty.exe -L <localport>:<remotehost>:<remoteport> <sshserver>

For example:

    putty.exe -L 8001:192.168.1.2:3389 adamkdean.co.uk

This will open up a PuTTY window. Authenticate and open up another cmd/mingw prompt. In this one we're now going to use `mstsc` (remote desktop) to connect through the tunnel. We opened up port `8001` on our local machine, so lets connect to that.

    mstsc -v localhost:8001

If you've done everything right, you should now get a remote desktop prompt.

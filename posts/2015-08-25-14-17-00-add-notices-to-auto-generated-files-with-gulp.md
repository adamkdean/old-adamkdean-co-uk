I wrote a little tool today to pop into my gulp workflow which writes some text to the top of files processed by gulp. The problem I find is that quite often you can be working on a project with source files and generated files (e.g. jsx -> js) and accidentally edit the wrong file, only for your changes to be overwritten.

This tool will put a notice at the top of auto-generated files to hopefully help put a stop to that. There are other packages that do this too, but so far in the past week there have been about 10 releases of gulp-header and quite a few of them were broken. Also they originated from godaddy so confidence in the package is pretty low!

## Usage

You can use the default notice:

    var gulp = require('gulp'),
        notice = require('gulp-notice');

    gulp.task('default', function () {
        gulp.src('src/*.js')
            .pipe(notice())
            .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/'));
    });

Which will prepend files with:

    /* --------------------------------------------------------------------- *\
    |  This code was auto-generated by a tool.                                |
    |                                                                         |
    |  Changes to this file may cause incorrect behavior and will be lost if  |
    |  the code is regenerated.                                               |
    \* --------------------------------------------------------------------- */

Or you can provide your own string as the first parameter:

    var gulp = require('gulp'),
        notice = require('gulp-notice');

    var text = '/* this file was auto-generated */';

    gulp.task('default', function () {
        gulp.src('src/*.js')
            .pipe(notice(text))
            .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/'));
    });

 Which will prepend files with:

    /* this file was auto-generated */

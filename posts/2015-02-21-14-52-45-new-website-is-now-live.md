There are still some features to complete, such as searching, commenting, responsiveness, blog archive and more, but we're close enough to go live.Since the fateful event of August 2014 when my [darling girlfriend](http://twitter.com/kirsty_dev) turned off all the power before a holiday and somehow destroyed the previous server and therein the old website, this site had been kept running barely by Ghost.Well, that's a thing of the past now. Ghost is...well, a ghost. A [codebase arises](https://github.com/adamkdean/adamkdean-co-uk).I'll be actively adding features and finishing off the edges over the next few months.Oh, and as a bonus, backlinks from my old website now work too.

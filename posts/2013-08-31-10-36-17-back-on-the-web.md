I have now successfully completed my 120 mile move from North West England to Middle England and with the internet back online and working, the site returns. It's been a difficult few weeks without the internet, I have resorted to doing things like going for walks, reading fiction books and just eating very slowly and thinking about things whilst looking at a blank kitchen wall.

I also start a new job on Monday which is exciting, but I will continue to write, though the blog posts may not be quite so frequent. I will probably have some better topics to write about now though!

Wish me luck!

Ideas:
======

- code highlighting
- search ability (using [this](https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/search-index)?)
- responsiveness -- let's make it work
- show more on tags so it's not right down the page?
- add in commenting ability (disqus?)
- drop down nav menu from header border
- replace time-stamp on filenames with directories?
